FreeCodeCamp Palindrome Checker - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker)

> Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

> Note
> You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

> We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

> We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".
